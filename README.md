# English-English Dictionary Web App

This project is a simple English-English dictionary application that allows users to input a word and get its meaning and pronunciation. The app is built using basic web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Word Input:** Users can enter an English word they want to define.
- **Word Meaning:** Once a word is entered, the app displays its definition.
- **Pronunciation Audio:** The app provides audio playback for the pronunciation of the entered word.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html:** This is the main HTML file that structures the web page and contains input fields and display areas for word definition and pronunciation.
- **style.css:** Handles the styling for the web page, including layout, font sizes, button designs, and responsiveness.
- **script.js:** JavaScript code responsible for fetching the word data and dynamically updating the webpage.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a word in the input field.
2. Upon clicking the "Translate" button, the app fetches the meaning and pronunciation of the word.
3. The results are displayed, including a button to play the pronunciation audio.
